          In 2012, Ted Cruz was elected as the 34th U.S. Senator from Texas. A passionate fighter for limited government, economic growth, and the Constitution, Ted won a decisive victory in both the Republican primary and the general election, despite having never before been elected to office.

          Propelled by tens of thousands of grassroots activists across Texas, Ted’s election has been described by the Washington Post as “the biggest upset of 2012 . . . a true grassroots victory against very long odds.”

          National Review has described Ted as “a great Reaganite hope,” columnist George Will has described him as “as good as it gets,” and the National Federation of Independent Business characterized his election as “critical to the small-business owners in [Texas, and], also to protecting free enterprise across America.”

          Ted’s calling to public service is inspired largely by his first-hand observation of the pursuit of freedom and opportunity in America. Ted’s mother was born in Delaware to an Irish and Italian working-class family; she became the first in her family to go to college, graduated from Rice University with a degree in mathematics, and became a pioneering computer programmer in the 1950s.

          Ted’s father was born in Cuba, fought in the revolution, and was imprisoned and tortured. He fled to Texas in 1957, penniless and not speaking a word of English. He washed dishes for 50 cents an hour, paid his way through the University of Texas, and started a small business in the oil and gas industry. Today, Ted’s father is a pastor in Dallas.

          In the Senate, Ted serves on the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; the Committee on Armed Services; the Committee on the Judiciary; the Joint Economic Committee; and the Committee on Rules and Administration.

          Before being elected, Ted received national acclaim as the Solicitor General of Texas, the State's chief lawyer before the U.S. Supreme Court. Serving under Attorney General Greg Abbott, Ted was the nation’s youngest Solicitor General, the longest serving Solicitor General in Texas, and the first Hispanic Solicitor General of Texas.

          <h2>Reasons to Donate to Ted Cruz</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Cruz has strong Tea Party support, which could stimulate renewed grassroots participation, engaging more voters in the democratic process. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Cruz is a leader who is not afraid to stand on principle, fight difficult fights, speak out for what he believes in, and buck Washington politics. His high-profile battles in the Senate over Obamacare and immigration serve as two examples.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cruz has a clear vision for the country, taking strong positions on a number of issues. For example, he said in his speech to launch his bid, "Imagine abolishing the IRS . . . Imagine a president that finally, finally, finally secures our borders . . . instead of a federal government that seeks to dictate school curriculum through Common Core. Imagine repealing every word of Common Core."
