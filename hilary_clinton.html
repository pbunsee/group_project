          <h2>Hilary Clinton is a Champion for Global Health Initiative.
          </h2>
          <p>One of Secretary Clinton’s greatest achievements is the Global Health Initiative (GHI), introduced in 2010. Designed to put a focus on maternal an infant health, the GHI has implemented strategy to improve medical facilities, reduce the spread of HIV, and lower infant and maternal mortality rates.
          </p>
          <h2>It is about Damn Time!</h2>
          <p>When a woman takes up the mantel of “Leader of the Free World,” our nation will cross a line, never to return. I’m not saying that Hillary Clinton becoming president will magically create nationwide gender equality, because it won’t. But when we join the ranks of countries like Germany, Denmark, and Chile by placing a woman as our Head of State, a new generation will grow up with an altered view of what a woman can do.
          </p>
          <h2>Experienced Leader</h2>
          <p>Hilary Clinton has been the First Lady for 8 years while her husband Bill Clinton was president. Hilary has served as the Secretary of State as well as being a senator in congress. With the vast experience that Hilary has; she is a candidate to be recokned with.</p>
    <h2>Lets Vote for Hilary Clinton Now!
    </h2>
    <p>Every vote counts. Hilary will help protect the consitution. If you dont vote, then you cannot complain.</p>
    <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
    <p>From the top three reasons, you can see why Hilary Clinton should be the only candidate you should choose. Forget the rest because HILARY IS THE BEST!<p></div>
