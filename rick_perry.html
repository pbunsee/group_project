         <p>James Richard "Rick" Perry (born March 4, 1950) is an American Republican politician who served as the 47th Governor of Texas from 2000 to 2015. A Republican, he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1998 and assumed the governorship in December 2000 when then-governor George W. Bush resigned to become President of the United States. Perry is the longest serving governor in Texas state history. As a result, he is the only governor in modern Texas history to have appointed at least one person to every eligible state office, board, or commission position (as well as to several elected offices to which the governor can appoint someone to fill an unexpired term, such as six of the nine current members of the Texas Supreme Court).

         Perry was elected to full gubernatorial terms in 2002, 2006 and 2010 and is the fourth Texas governor (after Allan Shivers, Price Daniel, and John Connally) to serve three terms. With a tenure in office to date of 14 years, 173 days, Perry was, at the time he left office, the second longest serving current U.S. governor—after Terry Branstad of Iowa. Perry served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2008 (succeeding Sonny Perdue of Georgia) and again in 2011.</p>

           <p>Perry, whose chances in 2016 likely hinge on his Iowa performance, is now a familiar face in the Hawkeye State, having already visited 30 times (Jeb Bush, by comparison, has been there twice). More importantly, he’s shown himself to be a far more polished, prepared candidate, according to several local Republicans.
           “He’s rebuilt his brand in this state,” said Craig Robinson, a longtime GOP operative in Iowa and the founder of The Iowa Republican blog. “The lack of focus on him in the early months of this race has allowed him to build a rapport with voters here. I think I’d be hard-pressed to find an Iowan who’s seen Rick Perry in the last six months who remembers the ‘oops,’ because he’s done that good a job.

           A more confident Perry emerged on Thursday, in an airplane hangar on the outskirts of Dallas with a C-130 transport aircraft, the plane Perry flew during five years in the Air Force, and dozens of decorated Navy SEALs and Medal of Honor recipients behind him. He hammered President Barack Obama, saying, “The truth is we are at the end of an era of failed leadership.”
           He blamed him for economic weakness at home and military weakness abroad, focusing on Obama’s decision to withdraw troops from Iraq, arguing that “no decision has done more harm.
           Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) announced his second campaign for president Thursday in Addison, Texas, with a rollicking rap/country riff that hit all the high notes in classic Lone Star fashion.

           “Rick Perry supporter, let’s protect our border. To hell with anyone who don’t believe in the USA, Rick Perry all the way," a recording of the song proclaimed, as the former governor made his way to the stage.

           “I won’t back up. I don’t back down. I been raised up. To stand my ground. Take my job. But not my gun," a second, country verse continued.
